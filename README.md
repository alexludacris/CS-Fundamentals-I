  Information learned completing projects:
  •Binary data representation in the modern computer, including the representation of non-numeric data.
  •Fixed-length number representations and their affect accuracy and precision on output.
  •Identifying properties of well coded algorithms.
  •Algorithms in the problem-solving process.
  •The software development process, good coding style, and algorithm development.
  •Use of pseudo-code to a programming language to implement, test, and debug algorithms for solving simple problems.
  •Techniques of structured (functional) decomposition to break a program into smaller pieces.
